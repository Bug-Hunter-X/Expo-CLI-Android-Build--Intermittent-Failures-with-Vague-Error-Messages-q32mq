Unfortunately, a consistent solution to this intermittent build failure hasn't been discovered yet.  The problem appears to be related to an underlying issue within the Expo build process rather than the code itself.  Possible workarounds include:

* **Cleaning the build cache:** Running `expo prebuild --clean` before each build attempt.  This is a workaround, not a fix, and sometimes doesn't resolve the issue.
* **Reinstalling the Expo CLI:** This can sometimes resolve dependency conflicts, but it's time-consuming and doesn't guarantee success.
* **Updating dependencies:** Make sure all your dependencies are up to date. However, the root cause doesn't seem to be related to outdated packages.
* **Check your Android Environment:** Ensure you have all the correct Android SDK components installed and configured properly.
* **Experiment with different Expo SDK versions:** If you are using a recent expo sdk version, try downgrading it to see if this fixes the problem.
