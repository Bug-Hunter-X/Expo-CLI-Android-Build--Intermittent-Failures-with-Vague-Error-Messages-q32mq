# Expo CLI Android Build: Intermittent Failures

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI.  The build process intermittently fails with non-specific error messages, hindering the debugging process.  The `expoBug.js` file showcases a minimal reproducible example (though the bug isn't in the code itself, but rather a mysterious interaction with the build process).  The `expoBugSolution.js` file is currently empty as a consistent solution has not been found; it's intended to hold a workaround or fix if one is discovered.
