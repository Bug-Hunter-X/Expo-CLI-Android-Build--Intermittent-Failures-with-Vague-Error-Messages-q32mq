This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with a cryptic error message, such as `FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.`  The error log often lacks specific details, making it difficult to diagnose the root cause. The build may fail intermittently, sometimes succeeding and other times failing without any apparent code changes.  This behavior is particularly frustrating because it lacks consistency and clear diagnostic information.  I've tried cleaning the build cache, reinstalling the Expo CLI, and updating dependencies, but none of these solutions consistently resolve the issue.
